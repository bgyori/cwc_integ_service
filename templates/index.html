        <h2>Bob with Bioagents dialogue system</h2>
        <p>
        Bob with Bioagents is a machine partner you can chat with
        about molecular biology and solve problems together.
        The system can be launched with two different interfaces, CLiC and
        SBGNViz below.
        </p>
        <p>
        To launch the dialogue system, please enter your name and email
        address, click on one of the launch buttons below, and wait
        (CLiC: 30 seconds, SBGNViz: 60 seconds) to get a dedicated instance of
        the dialogue system. Once started, the dialogue session will appear on
        the page and you can start talking with the machine agent.
        When you are done, click the
        <i>End Session</i> button above the dialogue interface.
        </p>
        <p>
        The dialogue system was last updated on June 30 2020.

      <p><b>Explaining a perturbation-readout experiment</b></p>
      <p class="lead">
        In this video, we formulate
        a hypothesis for "How does SB525334 decrease the amount of SMURF2?"
        (a hypothetical experimental observation) by talking with the machine
        partner, which turns your hypothesis into a mathematical model of
        biochemical mechansms over the course of the dialogue, and is able to
        verify that the model reproduces the observation of interest.
        This video uses the SBGNViz interface.

      In this video, we upload a list of genes and

      gene set enrichment analysis.

            integrated tab for uploading and discussing lists of genes and

        Assume you want to explain an experimental observation, or get
        some ideas for your next experiment. You can talk with the machine agent
        in some of the following ways:
        </p>
        <ul class="lead">
            <li>Ask about drugs, transcription factors, miRNAs and their targets</li>
            <li>Ask for mechanisms connecting molecular entities</li>
            <li>Define an observation you would like to find an explanation for</li>
            <li>Build up a model of a hypothesis by describing it in natural language</li>
            <li>Ask about dynamical properties of the model being discussed</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">
        Both interfaces show example sentences you can say. While the system aims
        to support substantial linguistic variation, following the pattern of these
        sentences is in some cases more reliable.
